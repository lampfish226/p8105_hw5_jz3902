## Problem 1

``` r
bdays_sim = function(n){

  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  
  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n

  return(duplicate)
  
}
```

``` r
sim_result = 
  expand_grid(
    n = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) %>% 
  mutate(result = map_lgl(n, bdays_sim)) %>% 
  group_by(n) %>% 
  summarize(prob = mean(result))

sim_result %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Birthday problem",
    x = "Group size",
    y = "Probability",
    caption = "The probability that at least two people in the group will share a birthday.")
```

After 10,000 simulations for each group size, the plot of probability vs
group size is close to a curve. When the group size exceeds 23, the
probability that at least two people in the group will share the same
birthday becomes greater than 50%.
